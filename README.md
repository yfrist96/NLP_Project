Sentiment Analysis with NLP Models

Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. The goal is to classify sentences from movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their sentiment.

We implemented and evaluated four different models:

Log-Linear Model with One-Hot Encoding

Log-Linear Model with Word2Vec Embeddings

LSTM Model with Word2Vec Embeddings

Transformer Model
